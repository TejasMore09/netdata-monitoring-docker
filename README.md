# Netdata System Monitoring with Docker

# Overview:
This project sets up Netdata, an open-source, real-time monitoring tool, inside a Docker container. Netdata collects and visualizes system and application performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory, disk activity, network traffic, and Docker container stats. It provides an easy-to-use web dashboard for monitoring system health live.

# Features:

Real-time monitoring of system resources

Visual dashboards showing CPU, memory, disk, network, and Docker container metrics

Integration with Netdata Cloud for centralized monitoring and alerting

Lightweight and minimal performance overhead

Easy installation and setup using Docker

# Installation and Usage:

Make sure Docker is installed and running on your machine.

Run the Netdata container with your claim token and room ID (if you want to connect to Netdata Cloud) using the command: " docker run -d --name=netdata -p 19999:19999 -e NETDATA_CLAIM_TOKEN=8ECMyfNWKh35pHqQSmo8xDUs8m8rMrZMt-EaLr2Btfcf0KGf6vLdSAR3a_NZUGQ-yumS_T-H9KHxD5c9ciEk2--61tFdnWK27niKcRUfr1Z9JzD3Mvrq23x2Mkh6XdaV_FKq3lY -e NETDATA_CLAIM_ROOM=00baa425-801e-4eac-8810-844ac929d441 -e NETDATA_CLAIM_URL=https://app.netdata.cloud netdata/netdata "

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:19999 to see the Netdata dashboard.

# What to Expect:
The dashboard shows live charts of CPU load, memory usage, disk I/O, network bandwidth, and running Docker containers. Alerts and logs can be accessed to monitor system health issues.

# Outcome:
This setup helps you understand lightweight, real-time monitoring for servers or applications using Netdata, which is useful for troubleshooting and performance tuning.
